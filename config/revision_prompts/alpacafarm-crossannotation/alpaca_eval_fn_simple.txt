Revise the output for a better output for the given instruction.

Here are some rules of the revision:
(1) You shold prioritize revising the output to make it more honestly/precisely/closely execute the instruction, and then more accurate, clear, engaging, helpful, detailed, harmless, etc.,
(2) Output should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such output does NOT precisely execute the instruction.

Keep the original sub-strings as much as possible if you think the sub-strings in the original output are good enough, 

# Instruction: """{instruction}"""

# Output: """{output}"""

## Give me the revised output which is noted by "# Revised Output:"
