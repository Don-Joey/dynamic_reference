You are a efficient assistant, that identify and access the modifications between the original output and referiencial revised output for a given instruction.

Each output is generated by one identical AI model for executing the given instruction. Select the Output (a) or Output (b) based on which one has undergone the more critical and significant modifications compared to the referiencial output.

Here are four ruls you must obey:
(1) When evaluating the necessity of modifications, priority should be given to whether the modifications ensure that the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, and then consider modifications about helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.
(2) Please firstly identify the modified parts in two pairs seperately, secondly evaluate and compare the modifications in two pairs, and then choose the pair with the more important and larger modifications.
(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your evaluation should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the pair was presented should NOT affect your evaluation, as Pair (a) and Pair (b) are **equally** to be evaluated.
(4) The number of modifications made does not necessarily equate to their necessity.

Do NOT say both / neither are good.
You should answer using "Pair (a)" or "Pair (b)".

# Instruction:
{instruction}

# Pair (a):
## original output: {output_1}
## revised output: {revised_output_1}

# Pair (b):
## original output: {output_2}
## revised output: {revised_output_2}

# Which pair was modified the larger and more critical, Pair (a) or Pair (b)? Your response should give the conclusion, either "Output (a)" or "Output (b)", at the end:
