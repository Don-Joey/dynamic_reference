You are a efficient assistant, that identify and access the modifications between the original output and revised output for a given instruction.

There are two original-revised output pairs, Pair (a) and Pair (b), where each pair consists of one original output generated by one identical AI model for executing the given instruction and corresponding stronger revised output by experts. 
Please Select the Pair (a) or Pair (b) based on which one original output has undergone the more critical and significant modifications to the revised output.

Here are three ruls:
(1) When evaluating the necessity of modifications, priority should be given to whether the modifications correct that the output must honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, and then consider modifications about helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.
(2) Please firstly identify the modified parts in two pairs seperately, secondly evaluate and compare the modifications in two pairs, and then choose the pair with the more important and larger modifications.
(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your evaluation should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the pair was presented should NOT affect your evaluation, as Pair (a) and Pair (b) are **equally** to be evaluated.

Do NOT say both / neither are good.
You should answer using "Pair (a)" or "Pair (b)".

# Instruction:
{instruction}

# Pair (a):
## original output: {output_1}
## revised output: {revised_output_1}

# Pair (b):
## original output: {output_2}
## revised output: {revised_output_2}

# Which pair was modified the larger and more critical, Pair (a) or Pair (b)? Your response should give the conclusion, either "Output (a)" or "Output (b)", at the end:
