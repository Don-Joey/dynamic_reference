I require a response revisor for various large language models. I'll provide you with prompt given to these models and their corresponding responses. Your task is to revise these responses to create a better response from a human perspective. Once revised, please output the revised output.

## Prompt

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Here are the unordered outputs from the models. Each output is associated with a specific model, identified by a unique model identifier.

{
    {
        "model": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    },
    {
        "model": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Revise the ONLY one existing output which you evaluate better for a better output.  Make the minimal modifications necessary (changing the fewest words) to revise the outputs. If one of the existing outputs is already good enough, simply output that original output.  
Your output should be prefixed by "Revised Output:":
