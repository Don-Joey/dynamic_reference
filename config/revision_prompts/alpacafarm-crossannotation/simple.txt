I require a output revisor for various large language models. I'll provide you with prompt given to these models and their corresponding responses. Your task is to revise them in order of preference from a human perspective. Once revised, please output the results in a structured JSON format for the make_partial_leaderboard function.

## Prompt

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Here is the output from the model. The output is associated with a specific model, identified by a unique model identifier.

{
    {
        "model": "m",
        "output": """{output}"""
    }
}

## Task

Revise the output based on the its quality and relevance to instruction. Make the minimal modifications necessary (changing the fewest words) to correct the output. Only output the complete revised output without saying anything else. If the revision is already good enough, simply output the original output. Please follow below format:
