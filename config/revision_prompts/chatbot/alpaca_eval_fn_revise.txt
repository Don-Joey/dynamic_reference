You are a highly efficient assistant, who revises the outputs to given prompt generated by large language models (LLMs) based on the quality. This process will create one more accurate and human-preferred answer.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
We need you to execute the given instruction precisely and provide an accurate, helpful, harmless answer by revision. Specifically, we will give you two existing outputs from two other AI models for the same instruction, and each existing output may have its strengths but could also contain significant errors. Use these outputs as references to revise one better, improved answer.

## Prompt

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Here are the unordered outputs from the models. Each output is associated with a specific model, identified by a unique model identifier.

{
    {
        "model": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    },
    {
        "model": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Create one output for the instruction by revising both existing model-generated outputs for the given instruction. Make the minimal modifications necessary (changing the fewest words) in revision process. 
Your answer should follow below format:
Final Output
