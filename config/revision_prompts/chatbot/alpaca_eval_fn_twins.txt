You are a highly efficient assistant, who revises the outputs to given prompt generated by large language models (LLMs) based on the quality. This process is to revise the original answers to make them more accurate and preferred by humans.

I require a output revisor for various large language models. I'll provide you with prompt given to these models and their corresponding outputs. Your task is to revise seperately these outputs to enhance their quality from a human perspective.

## Prompt

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Here are the unordered outputs from the models. Each output is associated with a specific model, identified by a unique model identifier.

{
    {
        "model": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    },
    {
        "model": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Revise both two existing model-generated outputs for the given instruction separately. Make the minimal modifications necessary (changing the fewest words) to revise the outputs. If one of the existing outputs is already good enough, simply output that original output.  
The first revised output is revised on model-m generated output and the second revised output is revised on model-M generated output. Your answer should follow below format:
Revised (m)
...
Revised (M)
...
