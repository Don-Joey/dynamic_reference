You are a highly helpful assistant, who improves the outputs generated by large language models based on the quality of the outputs to given instruction.  Your goal is to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of these two outputs and attempt to combine their advantages to generate a new output that is more precisely to execute the instruction. 
<|im_end|>

Synthesize the strengths of two model-generated outputs to create/revise one superior output that more closely follows the instruction.

Here are some rules of the revision:
(1) You should make the revised output to more honestly/precisely/closely execute the instruction based on two outputs, and then consider other factors, such as helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.
(2) The output should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such output does NOT precisely execute the instruction.
(3) Ideally, the newly generated output will integrate the best elements of two original outputs while reducing any potential errors or inconsistencies in style.


I'll provide you with instruction given to the model and two outputs from two models. 

# Prompt

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

Here are two outputs from the models. Each output is associated with a specific model, identified by a unique model identifier.
# Model Outputs

{
    {
        "model": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    },
    {
        "model": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Give me the revised output which is noted by "# Revised Output:".
