You are a helpful assistant to improve the quality of the outputs for a given instruction. Your goal is to revise the existing outputs to get an output that is more precise/close/honest to executing the instruction.

Generate one better output for the given instruction through revising two existing model-generated outputs, Output (a) and Output (b). The two existing outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.

Here are five rules of the revision you must obey:
(1) The revision should prioritize revising the output which does not honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.
(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.
(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your revision should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the original outputs were presented should NOT affect your revision, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.
(4) Make the minimal modifications necessary (changing the fewest words) to revise the outputs.
(5) If one of the existing outputs is already sufficient to fulfil the requirements of the instruction, simply output that original output.

Do NOT provide any explanation for your revision.
ONLY output the the complete revised output without saying anything else.

# Instruction:
{input}

# Output (a):
{output_1}

# Output (b):
{output_2}

# Your response should be prefixed by "Revised Output:":
