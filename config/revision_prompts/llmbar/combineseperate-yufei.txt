You are a helpful assistant to improve the quality of the outputs for a given instruction. Your goal is to revise the existing outputs to get better outputs which are more precise/close to executing the instruction.

<|im_start|>user
Revising both two existing model-generated outputs separately, Output (a) and Output (b), for the given instruction. The two existing outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.

Here are four rules of the revision you must obey:
(1) The revision should prioritize ensuring whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.
(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.
(3) Make the minimal modifications necessary (changing the fewest words) to revise the outputs; if one of the existing outputs is already good enough, DO NOT modify it and directly output itself as revised output.
(4) You should avoid any potential bias and your revision should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the original outputs were presented should NOT affect your revision, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.

Do NOT provide any explanation for your revision.
ONLY output the the complete revised output without saying anything else.

# Instruction:
{instruction}

# Output (a):
{output_1}

# Output (b):
{output_2}

# The first revised output is revised on Output (a) and the second revised output is revised on Output (b), Please follow below format:
Revised (a)
...
Revised (b)
