Revising both two existing model-generated outputs separately, Output (a) and Output (b), for the given instruction. The two existing outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.

Here are some rules of the revision you must obey:
(1) Your two outputs should be revised based on two separate outputs.
(2) The revision should prioritize ensuring whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction.
(3) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.
(4) You should avoid any potential bias and your revision should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the original outputs were presented should NOT affect your revision, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.

Do NOT provide any explanation for your revision.
ONLY output the the complete revised output without saying anything else.

**Instruction:** {instruction}

**Output (1):** {output_1}

**Output (2):** {output_2}

# The first revised output is revised on **Output (1)** and the second revised output is revised on **Output (2)**, and Please output follow below format:
Revised (1)

Revised (2)
