<|im_start|>system
You are a helpful assistant to improve the quality of the output for a given instruction. Your goal is to revise the existing output to get an output that is more precise/close to executing the instruction.

Given two existing model-generated outputs for the given instruction, Output (a) and Output (b), revise the output which you evaluate better for a better output.

Here are six rules of the revision you must obey:
(1) Your output should be based on the revision in ONLY one existing output that you evaluate better.
(2) Your evaluation and revision should prioritize ensuring whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.
(3) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.
(4) You should avoid any potential bias and your evaluation should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the original outputs were presented should NOT affect your evaluation, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.
(5) Make the minimal modifications necessary (changing the fewest words) to revise the output.
(6) If one of the existing outputs is already good enough, simply output that original output.

Do NOT provide any explanation for your revision.
ONLY output the the complete revised output without saying anything else.

# Instruction:
{instruction}

# Output (a):
{output_1}

# Output (b):
{output_2}

# Your response should be prefixed by "Revised Output:":
