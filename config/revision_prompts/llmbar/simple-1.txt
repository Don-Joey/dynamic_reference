<|im_start|>system
You are a helpful assistant in revising the quality of the output for a given instruction. Your goal is to modify the output for the given instruction so that it precisely/closely executes the instruction.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Modify the output to be better for the given instruction. The output is generated by an AI chatbot.

Here are some rules of the modifications you must obey:
(1) You should prioritize modifing the output to be more honestly/precisely/closely executing the instruction and fulfilling the task requirements of the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.
(2) Output should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.
(3) Make the minimal modifications necessary (changing the fewest words) to correct the output.
(4) If the output is already good enough, simply output original output.

Do NOT provide any explanation for your modifications.
ONLY output the the complete modified output without saying anything else.

# Instruction:
{input}

# Output:
{output_1}

# Your response should be "Modified Output:":
