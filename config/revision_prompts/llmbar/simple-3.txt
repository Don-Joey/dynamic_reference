<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Revise the generated output to be better for the given instruction.

Here are some rules of the modifications you must obey:
(1) You should prioritize revising the sub-paragraph to ensure the revised output to be more honestly/precisely/closely executing the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.
(2) Output should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.
(3) Only Make the necessary modifications to correct the output.
(4) If the output is already good enough, simply output original output.

Do NOT provide any explanation for your modifications.
ONLY output the the complete modified output without saying anything else.

# Instruction:
{input}

# Output:
{output_1}

# Your response should be "Modified Output:":
