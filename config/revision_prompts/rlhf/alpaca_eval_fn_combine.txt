I require a output revisor for various large language models. I'll provide you with prompt given to these models and their corresponding outputs. Your task is to revise these outputs to create a single better output with higher quality from a human perspective.

## Prompt

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Here are the unordered outputs from the models. Each output is associated with a specific model, identified by a unique model identifier.

{
    {
        "model": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    },
    {
        "model": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Create one output by revising based on both existing model-generated outputs for the given instruction. Make the minimal modifications necessary (changing the fewest words) to revise the outputs. If one of the existing outputs is already good enough, simply output that original output.  
Your answer should follow below format:
Final Output
